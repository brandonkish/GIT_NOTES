# RESTORE A PREVIOUS VERSION OF A FILE (EVEN IF DELETED)

## VIEWING THE FULL HISTORY

#### **git log --all --full-history --follow -- "\<FileName\>"**

    If you wish to find a file that was not in the root folder, and the path is unknown then use "**/<Filename>" instead.

    Also you can do "<Filename>.*" where '*' will be the extension for files where the extension is unknown.

    Typing "q" and pressing enter will exit the log.

    This shows the file's history across all branches.
